    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p>Bubble Under is a group of diving enthusiasts based in the sowtwest UK who meet up for diving trips in the summer months when the weather is good and the bacon rolls are flowing. We arrange weekends away as small groups to cut the costs of accommodation and travel and to ensure that everyone gets a trustworthy dive buddy.</p>
    <p>Although we're based in the south-west, we don't stay in our own turf: past diving weekends away have included trips up to Scapa Flow in Scotland and to Malta's numerous wreck sites.</p>
    <p>When we're not diving, we often meet up in a local pub to talk about our recent adventures (any excuse, eh?).</p>
    <p>Or as our man Bob Dobalina would put it</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"Hapiness is a dip in the ocean followed by a pint or two of Old Speckled Hen. You can quote me on that"</p>
